# copie-ableton

## Description

This is a copy of the Ableton page's functionality.

It allowed me to practice

- the realization of a dynamic menu
- positioning in the flex display
- the superposition of elements
- the realization of discrete animations thanks to CSS.
- creation of a slide in the header menu using CSS
- visual modification of the play/pause button of the video player

## Stack

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS made mobile first
